Program that generates music playlists from sketches. It's a collaboration done
with [[https://unnu.so/about/][Unnu]]. We use this to explore music in a playful way. Two patterns are
interesting:

1. Draw the right image to find a defined song, say, 'yellow submarine'.
2. Draw anything, a mood, a picture, a vision, and discover the suggested songs
   you get. This has limitations on the LLM's current state of knowledge.

Accessible [[https://lepisma-muse.streamlit.app/][here]]. You will have to put the following API keys in the interface to
make it work:

+ ~OPENAI_API_KEY~ for LLM access. You need GPT4 Vision access on this key.

Run ~poetry install~, then ~poetry run streamlit run scripts/serve.py~ if you are
running it locally.

* Changelog

** v0.2.0
Switch from a composition of ~salesforce/blip~ (image description) and
~gpt-3.5-turbo~ to ~gpt-4-vision-preview~.
